<a id="what-is-sehatvan" class="anchor" href="#what-is-sehatvan" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Sehatvan?</h2>

<img src="images/a.JPG" style='max-width:100%;' border="0" >

<p>Sehatvan is a healing space for body, mind and soul. It wishes to host healing programs for health and arts. Bordering a 4000-acre forest, it is a place to connect back to nature. It is hand-made using natural materials and traditional knowledge. Also, it dreams of becoming a tiny forest and vegetable garden in its own. </p>

<p>It has shared accommodation for 20 people and plenty of tenting space. We are trying to be sustainable in all living systems (food, water, energy, waste etc.).  It is situated 25km from Bhopal.</p>

<p>If you like our endeavour, you can support us in other ways too -
<ul>
<li> Start something similar. We need more people to go back to land and work in connection with nature. Earth needs more reforesting. More people working on similar ideas always gives courage and inspiration.</li>
<li> If you have a source of organic food, let us know. (not the super expensive kinds, please!)</li>
<li> Our wishlist, <a href="#wish-list">click here.</a> We wish to limit our dependence on money and buying new things. If you have any of the equipment/material goods that you can give away, we'll be super grateful!</li>
<li> Some people tell us that nobody knows about sehatvan or its work; that we need to spread the word out. We aren't great at that. But we really want to reach out to like-minded people. Help us connect and promote! Share on social media or tell your friend (who would like something like this)</p></li>
