  "body": "## What is Sehatvan?\r\n\r\nSehatvan is a healing space for body, mind and soul. It wishes to host healing programs for health and arts. Bordering a 4000-acre forest, it is a place to connect back to nature. It is hand-made using natural materials and traditional knowledge. Also, it dreams of becoming a tiny forest and vegetable garden in its own. \r\n\r\nIt has shared accommodation for 20 people and plenty of tenting space. A conscious effort is being made to keep all living systems around food, water, energy, waste in line with sustainability values. It is situated 25km from Bhopal.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How can we collaborate?\r\n\r\n### Join a program\r\nSehatvan organises workshops, retreats and gatherings related to health, arts and society. All the program are designed to involve oneâ€™s head, heart & hands and deep connection with nature. There are regular programs by Diabetes Trust on reversing lifestyle diseases.  See our future Programs. \r\n\r\n### Host a program \r\nSehatvan is open to be used as a hosting space. If you wish to host a workshop, retreat or a gathering in midst of nature and eco-built construction, we can work out something together.  \r\n\r\n### Creative Residency\r\nWe are open to hosting 1-2 people at a time who wish to work on their personal projects related to art, media, technology, writing etc. The resident will be expected to commit a few hours every day towards community work around cooking, taking care of plants or other related farm work. Minimum duration is 2 weeks. A modest amount will be charged for food. Please write to us about with a brief about you and your project to\r\n\r\n**To happen soon: Natural Jewellery, papier mache, wall painting.** \r\n\r\n### Sustainability Project\r\nIf you wish to work on a project idea that relates to sustainability (food, water, energy, plants etc) you are welcome to try it out at Sehatvan. If it connects with our needs, we can support with material, space and living.\r\n\r\n### Community Member\r\nIf you wish to take a break from the urban life and connect back to nature, this can be a good opportunity. You can join our team to develop sehatvan, hosting programs, taking care of plants, working on water harvesting etc. In return, we will take care of your food and stay. This can be a good sabbatical from busy life and you can use the time to develop your hobbies too.\r\nMinimum duration is 4 weeks.\r\n\r\n### Short Visits\r\nYou are welcome to stay with us for a short visit or 3-4 days or a weekend. There is plenty of options for nature walks, bird watching, camping, working with mud, wall paintings etc. You will be charged towards food and stay.\r\n \r\n### Other ways to support us \r\nIf you like our endeavour, you can support us in other ways too â€“\r\nâ€¢\tStart something similar. We need more people to go back to land and work in connection with nature. Earth needs more reforesting. More people working on similar ideas always gives courage and inspiration.\r\nâ€¢\tIf you have a source of organic food, let us know. (not the super expensive kinds, please!)\r\nâ€¢\tOur wishlist, click here. We wish to limit our dependence on money and buying new things. If you have any of the equipment/material goods that you can give away, weâ€™ll be super grateful!\r\nâ€¢\tSome people tell us that nobody knows about sehatvan or its work; that we need to spread the word out. We arenâ€™t great at that. But we really want to reach out to like-minded people. Help us connect and promote!
